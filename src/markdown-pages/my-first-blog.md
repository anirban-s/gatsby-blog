This is my first blog on SOLID principle. SOLID is an acronym of five design principle when we talk about
object oriented programming. These principles are mentioned below.

1) Single Responsibility Principle
2) Open/Closed Principle
3) Liskov Substitution Principle
4) Interface Segregation Principle
5) Dependency Inversion Principle


We will discuss in details about each design principle with C# code example.
This can be implemented in any OOP language.
