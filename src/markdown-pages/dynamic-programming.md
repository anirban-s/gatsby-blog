### Dynamic Programming.

In my opinoin, dynamic programming is a very good example of DRY(Do not repeat yourself). It states that, do not calculate in your code if the same operation is already performed. Instead, create a loopup and populate the lookup with calculated value. If the value is required in any future operation, find it in lookup and use the value. 

We will discuss an example for nth fibonacci number by recursive way and then by using dynamic programming.
